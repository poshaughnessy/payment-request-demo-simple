# Payment Request API simple demo

A simple front-end demonstration of the [Payment Request API](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/). 
It just simulates the server-side so won't actually take a real payment!
You can enter fake details or whatever you like to try it out.

## Instructions

To run locally, spin up any static web server, such as `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
or [Chrome's web server extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en).

Then load it up on your mobile browser with support for the Payment Request API - try Samsung Internet v5 or 
Chrome for Android. (Edge support is [coming soon](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2016/12/15/payment-request-api-edge/)).

If you're not familiar with pointing your mobile phone to a local server on your development machine,
there are some instructions [here](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/remote-debugging/local-server) 
and Samsung Internet specific info [here, under 'How do I debug'](https://medium.com/samsung-internet-dev/introducing-samsung-internet-for-developers-6c3a3be42f72).
